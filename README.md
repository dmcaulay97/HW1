# Homework 1 - Dylan McAulay

## Description
The goal of this homework assignment was to update existing code for a company homepage in order to make it more accessable, while not impacting the style and functionality of the original page. This involved changing all generic div tags to [Semantic Tags](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) and adding the [alt Attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp) to all img tags. As a consiquence of changing from divs to sematic tags, some of the css selectors being used in [style.css](assets/css/style.css) needed to be altered. All changes made to [index.html](index.html) and [style.css](assets/css/style.css) are reflected in the comments of those files.
